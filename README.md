# vfpmemberclass
VFP Grid MemberClass example

This project is setup to discover what needs to be done when adding the MemberClass and MemberClassLibrary on the projects base Grid class to an old code base.

Examples should include 
* using the baseGrid direction on a form
* using the baseGrid in a visual class
* subclassing a class that has the baseGrid as a member

The final goal is to have some code to process the project and get all the examples working using the new base column class as the MemberClass.
